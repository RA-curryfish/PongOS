# PongOS
Building my version of the BareBonesOS, a minimal OS built for the x86 architecture. Making the game 'Pong' on it, and coding in assembly and freestanding C (C without stdlib), and learning concepts in computer architecture, operating systems, linkers/loaders and so on.

## Progress
- Creating a file system
- Enabling and using paging for applications (WIP)
- Basic terminal to type in commands and interact with the OS (fixing small bugs)
- Launching applications (WIP - text app, Pong app)
- Refactoring code (WIP)
- ....
