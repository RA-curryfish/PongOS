	If the system has nothing more to do, put the computer into an

	1) Disable interrupts with cli (clear interrupt enable in eflags).
	   They are already disabled by the bootloader, so this is not needed.
	   Mind that you might later enable interrupts and return from
	   kernel_main (which is sort of nonsensical to do).
	2) Wait for the next interrupt to arrive with hlt (halt instruction).
	   Since they are disabled, this will lock up the computer.
	3) Jump to the hlt instruction if it ever wakes up due to a
	   non-maskable interrupt occurring or due to system management mode.
